# NFT Project Overview

This project introduces an enhanced feature, namely `borrowAuthNFT`, to the existing NFT contract. This functionality is now accessible to the public, enabling users to access and retrieve metadata associated with our NFTs.

## Prerequisites

- Flow Playground
- Cadence Language

## How to Use

To engage with the NFT project on the Flow Playground, follow these steps:

1. Develop your contracts, transactions, and script files directly within the Flow Playground environment.
2. Execute the `CreateCollection` transaction to establish the NFT collection.
3. Mint a new NFT by executing the `MintNFT` transaction.
4. Utilize the `GetID` script to obtain the NFT ID for use in the main script.
5. Execute the `MetaData` script to extract data from the created NFT.

This setup empowers users to effortlessly interact with the NFT project, taking advantage of the newly introduced `borrowAuthNFT` feature for seamless access to public metadata.
